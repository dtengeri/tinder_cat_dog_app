You can find the challenge details at https://flutterchallenge.dev/tinder-for-cats-and-dogs

You don't have to use this skeleton app if you don't want, feel free to start it from scratch.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to use a backend API and display its result with the help of the BLoC pattern.

## API

Documentation of the REST API: https://tinder-cat-dog-api.herokuapp.com/swagger.html

The API provides endpoints for getting the list of cats and dogs.

It also has an anonymus authentication endpoint (/auth), so you can get an identifier for your user in a form of JWT token.

Once you have the token you can create,update,remove the votes for each animal.
